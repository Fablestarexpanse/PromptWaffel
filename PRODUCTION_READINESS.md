- `src/index.html` (added update modal)
- `src/style.css` (added modal styles)
- `src/app.js` (integration)
- `src/events/eventListeners.js` (manual check)
- `src/tutorial.js` (keyboard shortcuts)

### 6. Documentation Updates

**Problem**: Outdated documentation and missing production information.

**Solution**:

- Updated README.md with v1.2.2 release notes
- Added version checking system documentation
- Updated build and test instructions
- Enhanced feature descriptions

**Files Modified**:
