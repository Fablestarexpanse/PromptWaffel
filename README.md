# PromptWaffel

**Break it. Remix it. Generate better.**

PromptWaffel is a desktop application for managing, organizing, and composing AI prompts. Built with Electron, it provides an intuitive visual interface for creating complex prompts from reusable components with drag-and-drop functionality.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation & Setup

#### **Option 1: Download Pre-built Release (Recommended)**

1. **Download**: Get the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PromptWaffle/PromptWaffle/releases)
2. **Install**: Run the installer for your operating system
3. **Launch**:
   - **Windows**: Use `npm run launch` from PowerShell/Command Prompt (recommended)
   - **macOS/Linux**: Use the provided launcher scripts

#### **Option 2: Development Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PromptWaffle/PromptWaffle.git
cd PromptWaffle

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch with launcher (recommended)
npm run launch

# Or launch directly (development)
npm start
```

### Launching the Application

#### **Windows Users:**

```powershell
# Option 1: Use npm (recommended - bypasses SmartScreen)
npm run launch

# Option 2: PowerShell launcher (better error handling)
.\launch-promptwaffel.ps1

# Option 3: Batch file (may trigger SmartScreen warning)
launch-promptwaffel.bat
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Windows SmartScreen Warning:**
If you see a "Windows protected your PC" warning when double-clicking the launcher:

1. Click "More info" in the warning dialog
2. Click "Run anyway" to proceed
3. **Alternative**: Use `npm run launch` from PowerShell/Command Prompt (bypasses SmartScreen)

#### **macOS/Linux Users:**

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x launch-promptwaffel.sh
./launch-promptwaffel.sh

# Or use npm
npm run launch
```

#### **First Time Setup:**

1. **Welcome Tutorial**: Complete the interactive tutorial to learn the basics
2. **Create Your First Snippet**: Use the "+" button or right-click on the board
3. **Organize**: Create folders to organize your snippets by category

- [ ] Track which LoRAs are used per prompt and display them inline.
- [ ] Add LoRA selection and insertion tools directly to the prompt builder.
- [ ] Add image metadata extraction for AI-generated images (e.g., LoRA, CFG, seed, model).
- [ ] Implement prompt metadata extraction from image files.

### Snippet and Board System

- [ ] Expand nesting options for snippets and board elements.
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop reordering of nested components.
- [ ] Improve UI clarity when working with deeply nested structures.

### Export and Integration
