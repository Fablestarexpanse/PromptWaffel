   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   Both should show version numbers if installed correctly.

#### **Step 2: Download & Setup PromptWaffel**

**Option A: Clone from GitHub (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Fablestarexpanse/PromptWaffel.git

```

### **Troubleshooting & Common Issues**

#### **Windows SmartScreen Warning**

If you see "Windows protected your PC" when launching:

1. **Click "More info"** in the warning dialog
2. **Click "Run anyway"** to proceed
3. **Alternative**: Use `npm run launch` from PowerShell (bypasses SmartScreen completely)

#### **"npm not found" Error**

If you get this error, you need to install Node.js:

If you get permission errors:

1. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
2. **Check folder permissions**: Make sure you have write access to the PromptWaffel folder
3. **Antivirus**: Temporarily disable antivirus if it's blocking the application

#### **Application Won't Start**

1. **Check Node.js**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed (`node --version`)
2. **Check npm**: Ensure npm is installed (`npm --version`)
3. **Reinstall dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the PromptWaffel folder
